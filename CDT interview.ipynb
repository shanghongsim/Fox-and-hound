    "Ways to imporve code:\n",
    "- make it more modular by introducing search function, eliminate for loops used to search for fox nd hound on board\n",
    "- make better searhc algorithms, reduce number of unnecessary checks, skip odd rows and columns\n",
    "- what happens if hounds reach end? bug cuz cannot move anywhere\n",
    "- increase efficiency of testing process. testing function implemented by looping through possible cases\n",
    "- pass more variables to decrease number of lines of code wirtten to find f and h, line 30 win function \n",
    "- make fox and hound objects\n",
    "- increase game complexity, level ups, make game more challenging and fun"
